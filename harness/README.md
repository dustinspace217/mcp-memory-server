# Memory Server Harness

The MCP server in this repo's root provides the storage layer (knowledge graph, vector search, temporal versioning). The harness in this directory is **everything else** that makes the server actually *useful across sessions and compactions* in a real Claude Code installation:

- **Hooks** that load L0 context on session start, flag stale memory entries, gate noisy writes, save snapshots at compaction boundaries
- **Skills** (`/audit-memory`, `/checkpoint`) that orchestrate maintenance and snapshot workflows
- **CLAUDE.md fragment** that establishes the Session Protocol and Mid-Session Memory Triggers
- **Settings/MCP registration examples** showing how the pieces wire into Claude Code

The server runs without any of this. The harness is what turns a generic MCP memory tool into the kind of system the [project goals](../CLAUDE.md#project-goals) describe — "fast, accurate, drift-resistant, and directly useful in the moment."

## Source of truth

These files are **verbatim copies** of what's running on the original installation (Fedora 43 KDE, `/home/dustin/.claude/hooks/`, `/home/dustin/.claude/skills/`). Hardcoded paths still contain `/home/dustin/Claude` and `/home/dustin/.claude` — the install script substitutes those at install time so the source remains a faithful record of what's deployed.

## Quick install

```bash
cd harness
./install.sh
```

The installer is idempotent. Existing files get timestamped backups before overwrite. It does **not** touch your `settings.json`, `~/.claude.json`, or `CLAUDE.md` — those merges are printed at the end for you to apply manually.

### Configurable destinations

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_HOME` | `$HOME/.claude` | Where Claude Code stores user config (hooks, skills, agents) |
| `WORKSPACE_BASE` | `$HOME/Claude` | Where your project directories live (parent of `mcp-memory-server/`) |
| `AUDIT_STATE_DIR` | `$HOME/.local/state/claude-memory-audit` | Watermark file for the `/audit-memory` skill |

Most users will accept the defaults. Override only if your Claude Code install lives somewhere unusual.

### What's intentionally not here

General-purpose code-review agents (`silent-failure-hunter`, `adversarial-tester`) and universal subagent-dispatch rules ("implementation = Sonnet min, review = Opus only") are part of the project author's broader Claude Code workflow, not specific to the memory server's runtime. Bundling them here would couple the server's install to one user's workflow defaults. They live in the source machine's `~/.claude/agents/` and top-level `CLAUDE.md` instead.

## How the pieces fit together

```
SessionStart event fires
  └─ load-l0-context.py (×3 chunks)
      └─ calls mcp__memory__get_context_layers → injects L0 rules into context
  └─ check-memory-freshness.py
      └─ scans entities with file paths in observations
      └─ flags any whose file mtime is newer than the most recent observation
      └─ writes flag report to /tmp/claude/memory-stale-flags.json

User makes a tool call (Edit, Write, etc.) — PreToolUse fires
  └─ block-sensitive-files.py  (separate concern, not in harness)

mcp__memory__add_observations or supersede_observations is called
  └─ PostToolUse → check-memory-noise.py
      └─ catches low-value observations (one-liner status, generic phrasing)
      └─ warns in stderr; does not block the write

Stop event (end of assistant turn)
  └─ memory-save-gate.sh
      └─ every ~10 turns, suggests a memory save checkpoint

PreCompact event (context window about to compress)
  └─ pre-compact-agent.sh
      └─ launches a Claude subagent with precompact-prompt.md
      └─ saves unsaved decisions/preferences/status to MCP before context is lost

PostCompact event
  └─ post-compact-agent.sh
      └─ re-loads L0 context and current project state into the compacted window

SessionEnd event
  └─ session-end-agent.sh
      └─ launches a Claude subagent with sessionend-prompt.md
      └─ extracts the session's durable outcomes into MCP entities/observations
```

## What the installer does NOT do

The installer stops short of any change that could conflict with existing config:

1. **Does not edit `~/.claude/settings.json`** — your hooks block likely has entries the harness shouldn't touch. The installer prints the snippet to merge.
2. **Does not edit `~/.claude.json`** — your MCP server registration lives here. The installer prints the `claude mcp add` command.
3. **Does not edit your `CLAUDE.md`** — the Session Protocol fragments are printed; you decide where they go and how they integrate with your existing prose.
4. **Does not build the MCP server** — that's a separate step (`npm install && npm run build` in the repo root). The installer reminds you if `../dist/index.js` is missing.
5. **Does not create the memory database** — it auto-migrates from JSONL on first run, or starts empty (see `../memory-install-instructions.md`).

## Verifying the install

After running `install.sh` and applying the printed integration steps, restart Claude Code and check:

```bash
# Server registered:
grep -A 6 '"memory"' ~/.claude.json | head -10

# Hooks present and executable:
ls -la ~/.claude/hooks/load-l0-context.py ~/.claude/hooks/check-memory-freshness.py

# Skills discoverable:
ls ~/.claude/skills/audit-memory/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/checkpoint/SKILL.md

# Database accessible:
sqlite3 ~/.claude/memory.db "SELECT version FROM schema_version;"
```

In a new Claude Code session, the first system reminder should contain `# MEMORY (chunk 0 of N, project=...)` — that's the L0 auto-load firing.

## Updating the harness

If a hook is updated on the source machine, regenerate the harness by re-copying:

```bash
cd /path/to/mcp-memory-server
cp ~/.claude/hooks/{load-l0-context.py,check-memory-freshness.py,check-memory-noise.py,memory-save-gate.sh,periodic-memory-check.sh,session-end-agent.sh,sessionend-prompt.md,pre-compact-agent.sh,precompact-prompt.md,post-compact-agent.sh,test_check_memory_freshness.py} harness/hooks/
cp ~/.claude/skills/audit-memory/SKILL.md harness/skills/audit-memory/
cp ~/.claude/skills/checkpoint/SKILL.md harness/skills/checkpoint/
git diff harness/
```

Then commit. The next person to run `install.sh` (including you on another machine) gets the update.

## Why bundle this with the server

[Project goals](../CLAUDE.md#the-three-durable-goals-abc) — A (reduce drift), B (faithful recall), and C (better conversations / quality code) — are not achieved by the server alone. The server is a knowledge graph store; the harness is what turns it into a memory system. Without the harness:

- L0 rules don't auto-load → drift returns at every session start
- Stale entries don't get flagged → recall produces facts that were true months ago
- Compaction loses unsaved context → conversation continuity breaks
- Noise builds up unchecked → the noise crowds out the useful observations

Each piece in this directory addresses a specific failure mode the bare server doesn't cover. The original Lumidex / Sep 2026 incident referenced in `feedback_smallest_sufficient_fix.md` is exactly the shape of failure the harness exists to prevent.
